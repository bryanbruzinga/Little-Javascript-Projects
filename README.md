# Little Javascript Projects
 A couple of basic projects i did as a challenge based on a YouTube video where it had no solutions at all, only the functionalities and the system itself working.

 * First Project - [To-do List](https://codepen.io/bryanbruzinga/pen/QWKawPb). An extremely simple to-do list. 
 * Second Project - Fixing bugs
 * Third Project - [Note Taker](https://codepen.io/bryanbruzinga/pen/YzGYXYb). This one was fun to do, a good way to practising flex positioning and modal.
 * Forth Project - [Vowel Counter](https://codepen.io/bryanbruzinga/pen/YzGYXao). Not gonna Lie, this was the easiest one.
